This is a Python-based weather application built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching real-time weather data. The program allows users to input a city name and displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, and description.

To run this code, you'll need:

1.Python installed on your system.
2.Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python).
3.The requests, pandas, and numpy libraries, which you can install via pip install requests pandas numpy.
4.An internet connection to access the OpenWeatherMap API.
